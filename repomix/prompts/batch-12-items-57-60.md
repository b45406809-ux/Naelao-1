# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 12, plan items 57–60

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Artifact CAS, locks, trusted PRs, and rebases**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 57. Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with SHA-256 Checkpoints

**Final behavior:** Atomic Compare-And-Swap file writes verified against SHA-256 base hashes, preventing concurrent users or agents from clobbering code.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: RepositoryDO/workspace write adapters.
Persistence/deployment: Git objects/refs and R2.
Required observable verification: repository stale-revision tests cover refs, not all file-write ingresses.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- - **Entry gate** (`NaelaoAgentDO.handleScriptRun`): a project-scoped run that acts on behalf of a
  user (non-empty `userId`, excluding the channel drain's synthetic `channel:...` ids, which never
  route through here anyway) resolves the clamp via a new `fetchAssistantAccess` (internal HMAC
  call to the existing spaces-worker endpoint) BEFORE any billing gate. `null` effective role
  (`assistant_mode='none'`, or a plain non-member) → 403 `assistant_access_denied`; lookup error →
  403 `assistant_access_unverified` (fail CLOSED — the fetchProjectConfig/F17 posture: an
  authorization check that fails open isn't one). No acting user (cron/trigger/webhook/bootstrap
  wakes) → no clamp, the as

- #### Layer 1: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC / Hash Checkpoint)
Every file in your authoritative SQLite `workspace_files` table carries a **SHA-256 content hash**.
When an agent calls `Edit(filePath, oldString, newString)`, the DO SQLite write enforces a **Conditional Checkpoint**:
```sql
-- Atomic OCC Update in DO SQLite
UPDATE workspace_files
SET content = ?, hash = ?, size_bytes = ?, updated_at = datetime('now')
WHERE path = ? AND hash = ?; -- Verified against hash at start of turn!
```
* **If another user/agent edited the file mid-turn:** `changes === 0`. The DO throws an instant conflict exception:
  > `✖ Conflict Error: 'src/Header.astro' was modified by another thread 1.2s ago. Re-read lines before applying patch.`
* The agent reads the fresh lines with `Read` and self-heals its patch cleanly.
- #### Core Architectural Blueprint
Multi-agent concurrency across shared workspaces is organized into a four-tier operational structure enforced by stateful edge actors:

### 58. Distributed File-Level Mutex Locks (`ConcurrencyDO`)

**Final behavior:** Multi-file refactoring acquires 30-second TTL locks on file keys. Crashed agents automatically release locks on expiration.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: LockDO and lock prebuilt request path.
Persistence/deployment: Durable Object SQLite state and alarms.
Required observable verification: concurrency/fail-closed tests cover primitive races; orchestration enforcement remains.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- - **F10 (Tier-2/3 isolates get raw, unguarded `fetch`, spec G-AF20)** — **already fixed**, in
  the same pass that closed F13 for the browser worker (see A1.16 Track B/F10+F13 above,
  commit tagged `9a541e1`-equivalent). `workers/agents/src/script-engine/code-runner.ts`'s
  `SSRF_GUARD_PRELUDE` overrides `globalThis.fetch` inside the isolate module text itself
  (`__ssrfGuardedFetch`), and the injected `ctx.fetch` calls that same guarded function — not
  the bare `fetch`. Confirmed by reading the current file (not assuming from memory): lines
  ~87-114 show the guard, line ~124 shows `ctx.fetch: (...a) => __ssrfGuardedFetch(...a)`.

- #### Layer 2: File-Level Mutex Locks (`lock.ts` / `ConcurrencyDO`)
Before an agent begins a complex, multi-file refactor:
1. It calls `lock.acquire({ key: "file:src/Header.astro", holderId: threadId, ttlMs: 30000 })`.
2. If another thread holds the lock, the agent does not crash—it adapts:
   * *"Header.astro is currently locked by Bob's task. I will work on `Footer.astro` and return to Header later."*
3. Locks carry a 30-second TTL in `ConcurrencyDO` so a crashed agent never deadlocks a file forever.

### 59. Inline Pull Request (PR) Review Cards

**Final behavior:** Merges from branches to `main` render interactive cards with visual AST diffs, author attribution, and one-click merge buttons.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: artifact branches and shell artifact card.
Persistence/deployment: RepositoryDO durable Git object storage.
Required observable verification: artifact tests do not prove trusted diff rendering plus membership-checked merge.

**Retained implementation constraints:**

- # PART 3: Cloudflare Virtual FS Branching & "Pull Request" (PR) Engine
You can implement a **Git-like Branching and Pull Request (PR) workflow** directly inside the **Authoritative SQLite Virtual Filesystem (`workspace_files`)** of your Durable Object.
This allows users or specialist agents in **Tier 4 Private Scratchpads** to make changes on a **virtual branch**, verify the code in isolation, and then open a **Pull Request Card** in the **Tier 1 Main Team Room** where team members review visual diffs and merge them atomically to the main project.

- ### Summary of What This Adds to the Platform
| Feature | How It Works with Cloudflare Artifacts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Upstream Staleness Tracking** | Real-time `commitsBehind` badges across all scratchpads and task threads. |
| **Smart Agent Rebase** | Agents inspect upstream diffs before pulling, auto-rebasing non-overlapping files. |
| **Turn-by-Turn Time Machine** | 1-click rollback to any historical agent turn via instant Git commit resets. |
| **Reasoning-Aware `git-blame`** | Agents read historical commit reasoning to understand why past code was written. |
| **Multi-Model Branch Races** | Fork 3 branches for 3 models in parallel; merge the winning benchmarked code. |
| **AST-Aware Merge Resolver** | AI resolves Git merge conflicts automatically by understanding code syntax. |

### 60. Upstream Staleness Detection & Auto-Rebase

**Final behavior:** Tracks branch divergence (`2 commits behind main`). Autonomously rebases non-conflicting files and surfaces overlaps for review.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: RepositoryDO refs/history.
Persistence/deployment: immutable Git objects and refs.
Required observable verification: stale-revision tests are not a stale-branch rebase journey.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- Required Fix: A codebase-index skill (Tier 2, runs in the sandbox's own git checkout — see G-BG09) builds and incrementally maintains a lightweight symbol/import/schema dependency graph of the operator's registered repository, stored as structured rows (not prose) in a new operator_dependency_graph table, refreshed on every merged change rather than recomputed from scratch. Before the SRE/QA agent green-lights a spec, it runs qa.blast_radius(changed_files) , which walks the graph outward N hops and returns the concrete list of call sites, schema consumers, and existing tests that touch the changed surface — turning "generate and run regression tests" from a blind full-suite re-run into a tar
- - `workers/agents/src/connectors/oauth.ts` — generic OAuth2+PKCE helpers (not Whop-specific code;
  any future connector with a catalogue `oauth` spec reuses these): `generatePkce`,
  `buildAuthorizeUrl`, `exchangeCodeForTokens`, `refreshTokens` (Whop rotates the refresh token on
  every use — the new one is always persisted, the old one never reused), and a KV-backed
  single-use OAuth ticket (`issueOAuthTicket`/`consumeOAuthTicket`) mirroring the codebase's own
  stream-ticket precedent: a short-lived, server-held, single-use ticket rather than putting a
  PKCE verifier or any credential in a browser-navigable URL.

- ### 2. How the Agent Evaluates Upstream Changes (Smart Reconciliation)
When an agent notices its scratchpad branch is behind `main`, it doesn't blindly fail. It runs an **Autonomous Upstream Impact Assessment**:
```typescript
// workers/agents/src/script-engine/prebuilt/git-sync.ts
export const checkAndReconcileUpstream = async (ctx: PrebuiltOpContext) => {
  const git = ctx.env.artifactsGit;
  const status = await git.getDivergenceStatus(ctx.env.projectId, ctx.env.threadId);
  if (status.commitsBehind === 0) {
    return { status: "UP_TO_DATE", message: "Branch is fully synchronized with main." };
  }
  // 1. Fetch exact git diff of what changed upstream on main
  const upstreamDiff = await git.getUpstreamDiff(status.baseCommit, status.upstreamHead);
  // 2. Compare upstream changed files with the files the agent is currently modifying
  const myActiveFiles = (await ctx.env.fs.glob("src

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
