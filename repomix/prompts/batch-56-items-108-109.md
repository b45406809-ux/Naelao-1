# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 56, plan items 108–109

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Plan items 108–109**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 108. Native In-Composer Voice Dictation

**Final behavior:** WhisperFlow-style dictation in chat bar, capturing audio from browser microphone and transcribing via Workers AI Whisper for $0 compute.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- Required Fix Build a <VoiceInput> component: (1) Push-to-talk button: hold to record (releases to submit), or toggle mode (click to start, click to stop). Visual state: idle (microphone icon), recording (pulsing red circle + timer). (2) Waveform visualization: real-time audio level bar chart rendered on canvas (AudioContext analyser node). Shows user if microphone is picking up audio. (3) Real-time transcription preview: as the user speaks, partial STT results appear in a preview box above the button. (4) Transcription correction: after recording, the user can edit the transcription before submitting. (5) Error states: microphone permission denied (clear error with link to browser permission
- - **T2's real architectural prerequisite, resolved:** the shell's chat call path
  (`/spaces/:spaceId/sessions/:sessionId/agent/run`) had no concept of "which named agent" — it
  always addressed ONE DO instance per bare `sessionId`. Fixed at the source rather than adding a
  parallel endpoint: `/agent/run` now addresses `{sessionId}:{agentDefinitionId}` whenever an
  explicit `agent_definition_id` is given (unchanged, bare-`sessionId` addressing when it's
  absent — every existing single-agent session is unaffected). The new `/agent/mention-run`
  endpoint is a thin dispatcher on top of this, not a second reasoning path.

### 109. Private Executive Copilot Channel

**Final behavior:** An on-the-go Chief of Staff connecting the owner's personal WhatsApp/Telegram to the Space Assistant. Outside customers cannot reach this channel.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- Spec §05 (byte ~116k): *"One assistant per user per Space by default. Admin can raise
this limit."* The **company state is shared** and space-level — `SpaceDO` (members,
structure, billing) + `ProjectDO` workspaces (file **locks**, **version history**,
**real-time presence**, byte ~399k/§12) + threads + KB. Each user's assistant
(`assistants/{userId}/`, byte ~411k) is a personal chief-of-staff acting **on** that
shared company — it is **not** a private fork of the company. Two members' assistants do
not build two companies because they read/write the *same* `ProjectDO`. Coordination =
file locks + presence + **project deduplication** (admin's assistant broadcasts "this
already exists"). This

- 190 - 192
We said user gets their own space/business assistant that they connect their own channels like WhatsApp or telegram etc should this also be there in non autonomous business templates the cowork templates
**YES, absolutely.** In fact, having WhatsApp and Telegram connected to non-autonomous / vertical cowork spaces is **one of your biggest competitive advantages over Harvey AI, Legora, and Claude Cowork.**
Products like Harvey AI or desktop Claude are **trapped on a desktop browser**. A lawyer walking into a courtroom, a doctor doing hospital rounds, an architect on a construction site, or an investment banker in a taxi cannot easily open a 15-inch laptop to check a document.
Giving every professional a **personal WhatsApp / Telegram channel to their firm's Cowork Space** turns the system into an on-the-go **Executive Chief of Staff**.
- 193 - 195
No in the venture templates channels are  for the owner is to access their assistant on WhatsApp telegram etc just like in vertical cowork but for connecting whatapp bots discord bots telegram bits etc like those customer service automations let's keep them under projects of kind=customer bots users can configure such projects to do customer service automations and even the execution ladder for these projects is lower to avoid security threats.
With this I realize there should be more project kinds besides customer bots and using plugins each will have different UI plus there should be project templates for each kind

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
