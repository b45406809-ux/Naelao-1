# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 49, plan items 94–95

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Plan items 94–95**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 94. Cloudflare Queues Concurrency Buffering

**Final behavior:** Buffers incoming webhook bursts (e.g. 10,000 Shopify Black Friday orders) into Cloudflare Queues, pacing worker execution safely.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- ## Stack
- CF Workers (router, auth, spaces, agents, knowledge, billing, etc.)
- CF Durable Objects + DO SQLite (`SpaceDO` = structure/agent_definitions, `NaelaoAgentDO` = agent runtime, sessions, memory)
- CF R2 (KB documents, exports, backups, artifacts)
- CF Vectorize (KB semantic search — shared multi-tenant index with spaceId filter)
- CF KV (circuit breakers, config cache, session revocation, portal routes)
- CF Queues + DLQ (async events, webhook delivery, analytics, notifications)
- CF Workflows (provisioning, erasure, ingestion, billing, dunning)
- CF Analytics Engine (events, metrics — append-only, 25M rows/day limit)
- D1 (platform metadata, billing, users — single instance today;
- The Gap
 None of the wrangler.jsonc queue consumer definitions set `max_concurrency`. When a burst of messages arrives (e.g., 500 run-complete notifications from a parallel workflow), CF Queues spawns up to 250 concurrent Worker invocations by default. Each invocation makes calls to APNs, FCM, Slack webhooks, and Analytics Engine. APNs rate-limits at 300 requests/second per certificate. FCM limits at 500/second. The burst from unbounded queue consumers hits these limits immediately, triggering 429 errors, causing messages to be retried, causing more burst, in a cascading failure loop.
- - **Money-in is reserved.** `RESERVED_CAPABILITIES` (checkout, charge, payout, wallet, …) may
  only be provided by Naelao's **prebuilt `commerce` script**, which holds the Lemon Squeezy
  store credentials (Workers Secret) and bakes in the platform fee (`naelaoFeeBps`).
  `ScriptToolSurface.create/update` **fail closed**: a user/agent script that references an
  external payment host (Stripe/PayPal/… *and* `api.lemonsqueezy.com`), embeds a payment SDK,
  or declares a reserved capability/domain is rejected. Builders keep full freedom to author
  delivery, marketing, storefront-UI, and email scripts — just not the wallet. 9 unit tests.

### 95. Time-Travel Webhook Event Replay Lake in R2

**Final behavior:** Archives raw webhook payloads to Cloudflare R2 with 14-day retention rules, enabling 1-click replaying of historical events against patched code.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- 98. **The assistant had never once been told who it was, `/new` silently dropped the user's first
    message, and a completed run 404'd on its own status poll. All three reported by the user, all
    three root-caused against live behaviour rather than guessed at.**
    - **The agent's own system prompt reached the model in no run, ever.** `loadAgentConfig` read
      `system-prompt.md` from R2 on every call and used it only to parse approval gates;
      `GatewayReasoner` hardcoded `system: DECISION_INSTRUCTIONS`. Every word of
      `LAUNCHPAD_ASSISTANT_PROFILE` — the business-building methodology, the wallet rules, "read the
      project journal first" — written, stored, never delivered
- The Gap: Builders want to automate actions within their Space based on events (e.g., "when end-user hasn't returned in 7 days, send a re-engagement email"; "when Space error rate exceeds 5%, send Slack alert"). No event-driven automation framework exists within Spaces. Builders must build this externally via webhooks (G-AR41) and their own infrastructure.
 Required Fix: Add Space Automation rules to SpaceConfig: automations: [{trigger: {event: "end_user_inactive", condition: {idle_days: 7}}, action: {type: "send_email", template_id: "...", to: "{{end_user.email}}"}}] . Trigger types: end_user_inactive, error_rate_exceeded, budget_threshold, new_end_user, conversation_completed . Action type
- `GET .../agent/runs/:runId/stream` used named SSE events (`event: status`, `event: done`) with
payloads carrying no `type` field. A browser's native `EventSource.onmessage` only fires for
UNNAMED (default `message`) events — so it never fired for this endpoint's output at all. Read all
three known chat clients (`apps/shell/Chat.tsx`, `apps/widget/naelao-chat.ts`,
`apps/portal/.../page.tsx`) and confirmed they independently already expect an unnamed event
carrying `{type: "delta"|"done"|"error", ...}` — a systemic, shared assumption, not a typo in one
file. The only way any client ever progressed was `onerror` firing once the stream closed
(interpreted as a dropped connection), falling back t

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
