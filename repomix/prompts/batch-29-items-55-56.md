# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 29, plan items 55–56

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Plan items 55–56**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 55. 4-Tier Thread Hierarchy

**Final behavior:** Project conversations partitioned into Team Rooms (Tier 1), Task Workstations (Tier 2), Consult Lanes (Tier 3), and Private Scratchpads (Tier 4).

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: SpaceDO conversations and agent scratchpad helpers.
Persistence/deployment: SpaceDO/agent DO SQLite.
Required observable verification: conversation access tests exist; four-tier journey remains missing.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- - ~~**Credential hierarchy**~~ — **BUILT** (see A1.16.5). Per-user (default) + per-space
  (shared) + per-privileged-user overrides, in `workers/credentials`. Also closed a
  pre-existing gap: `space_credentials` had no migration at all — the worker would have
  thrown at runtime against a real D1.
- **MCP as scripts**: agents never connect to MCP directly; they write/use scripts that wrap
  MCP providers (Pipedream, Composio).
- ~~**Member/seat billing**~~ — **BUILT** (see A1.16.4). Lemon Squeezy billing for a builder's
  space-members (the third payer class): `/internal/seats/checkout` + LS-webhook
  `recordSeatActivation` (member activated on paid seat) already existed; this pass added th

- ### 1. Solving Thread Sprawl: The 3-Tier Thread Hierarchy
Do not allow an unorganized flat list of 50 disconnected threads. Structure project conversations into **3 clear tiers**:
* **Tier 1: The Main Project Channel (The "Team Room"):**
  * The single, always-present central room for the project.
  * All team members and the project's default agent discuss high-level updates, roadmaps, and milestones here.
* **Tier 2: Feature & Task Threads (Branch Workstations):**
  * Created for specific subtasks or bugs (e.g., `Thread #102: Stripe Webhook Refactor`).
  * Scoped to that specific task's `Todo` DAG state. Once completed, the thread is archived.
* **Tier 3: Sub-Agent Consult Lanes (Private Subthreads):**
  * Private background exchanges between the Space Assistant and specialist agents. Completely collapsed in the UI so they never clutter the human chat feed.
- #### Core Architectural Blueprint
Multi-agent concurrency across shared workspaces is organized into a four-tier operational structure enforced by stateful edge actors:

### 56. Solo 2-Tier Cockpit vs. Multi-User 4-Tier Digital Office

**Final behavior:** Solo founders see a streamlined 2-Tier Cockpit (Chat + Live Canvas); inviting teammates dynamically promotes to the full 4-Tier Digital Office.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: shell project/thread surfaces only.
Persistence/deployment: no explicit cockpit-mode migration state.
Required observable verification: UI shells are not end-to-end evidence; promotion test is required.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- 129. **Investigated the reported "no credits dialog with 5000 credits" bug thoroughly — all four
     distinct billing gates were confirmed HEALTHY for the account at investigation time; most
     likely a timing issue, not a live code bug. Plus three real, independently-reported UI/UX
     gaps, all fixed: mobile sidebars unreachable, the Message/text-tab button missing from the
     composer dock, and the verification email carrying no usable link.**
     - **Credits-dialog investigation.** Read-only (zero LLM cost, via a temporary service-bound
       worker mirroring items 128/62's own established technique) checks against all FOUR
       distinct `insufficient_credits`/`quota_exceeded`
- Required Fix: A codebase-index skill (Tier 2, runs in the sandbox's own git checkout — see G-BG09) builds and incrementally maintains a lightweight symbol/import/schema dependency graph of the operator's registered repository, stored as structured rows (not prose) in a new operator_dependency_graph table, refreshed on every merged change rather than recomputed from scratch. Before the SRE/QA agent green-lights a spec, it runs qa.blast_radius(changed_files) , which walks the graph outward N hops and returns the concrete list of call sites, schema consumers, and existing tests that touch the changed surface — turning "generate and run regression tests" from a blind full-suite re-run into a tar
- First concrete step of the full-vision plan (Naelao → Builder → End User, end user gets the
launchpad-6-mockup agentic workspace; see the established architecture item 30 for the complete phased plan A-E).
Phase A had two deliverables: a shared design system, and a running end-user shell app that can
resolve a product, sign an end user up or in, and render the manifest-driven chrome — no chat yet
(that's Phase B).

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
