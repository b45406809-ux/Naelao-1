# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 50, plan items 96–97

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Plan items 96–97**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 96. Leaky-Bucket Outbound Rate-Limiter Pacer

**Final behavior:** Paces outbound API requests through `ConcurrencyDO` (e.g. max 5 req/sec to HubSpot or Instagram), preventing external provider HTTP 429 bans.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- 126. **Three more live-reported bugs, all root-caused to the SAME underlying gap: the reasoner's
     "available_operations" field was a bare flat list of 60+ op names with no description or
     grouping — plus two silent trace-persistence holes that hid real repeat/parked tool calls
     from the activity table.**
     - **The real root cause of "our API doesn't support programmatic thread creation or direct
       in-thread chat messaging"** (item 125 shipped exactly that capability the same session).
       `project-coordination` WAS wired into the assistant's prebuilt list and `tools.
       availableOperations()` DID include `thread.create`/`thread.send_message` in the payload —

### 97. Payload Hash Idempotency Deduplication

**Final behavior:** Hashes provider event IDs and resource IDs in SQLite. Duplicate events received within 24 hours are acknowledged and discarded.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Expose the feature through its authenticated production ingress; persist scoped state in the authoritative worker or Durable Object; declare every required binding in development, staging, and production; connect the applicable shell surface; and prove the complete journey with non-trivial integration and isolation tests.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- 74. **The four items item 73 left open are now BUILT — plus a real bug found while closing them:
    the script-native path never persisted the assistant's answer.** The client writes the USER
    message before dispatching, but nothing wrote the reply, so a reload showed questions with no
    answers, the agent's own conversation memory (item 71 — which reads that same SpaceDO
    transcript) only ever saw the user's half, and a resumed run had nowhere to put its result.
    `handleScriptRun` now writes the answer back via a new `writeAgentAnswerToSession` —
    deliberately NOT the legacy `writeConversationToSession` goal+answer pair, which would
    duplicate every question — attributed w
- Required Fix
 Required Fix Add an idempotency key to webhooks: store a hash of (spaceId, provider, event_type, event_id) and reject duplicate webhooks within a 24-hour window. Use a unique constraint on space_triggers to prevent duplicate registrations: no two triggers with the same (space_id, provider, event_type, target_type, target_id). Make workflow execution idempotent: if the same workflow is triggered twice with the same input, the second one is a no-op. Severity: Medium — Concurrent triggers cause duplicate workflow dispatches. No idempotency key or deduplication. Workflows execute multiple times for single webhooks. T-173 — naelao-notifications
- **Explicit signals — no new ingestion.** `agent_activity_log` (item 40) already carries
`event_type`/`tokens_used`/`cost_credits`/`created_at` for every run completion/failure and
approval request — exactly what error rate and avg/total cost need. New `GET /spaces/:spaceId/
agent-signals?project_id=&window_hours=` (SpaceDO's `computeAgentSignals`, builder-only, same
gate as `agent-activity`) rolls it up on read: `runs_total/completed/failed`, `error_rate`,
`avg_cost_credits`, `total_cost_credits`, `approvals_requested`. "Regenerations" (a proxy for the
user hitting retry) is computed in application code — 2+ run events on the SAME thread within 5
minutes — rather than a SQL window function,

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
