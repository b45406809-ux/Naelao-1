# AI Studio implementation prompt — batch 23, plan items 43–44

## Mission

Implement every requirement below end to end on the current accumulator branch. The cohesive focus
is **Plan items 43–44**. This prompt is self-contained: the feature definitions and retained implementation
constraints have already been extracted and reconciled into the final specification below.
Do not seek or cite external design context. Repository code is evidence of current
state, not evidence that a requirement is complete.

## Non-negotiable production rules

- Trace and use the real router → authorization → worker/Durable Object → scoped persistence or
  binding → shell path. A helper, type, schema, comment, standalone endpoint, mock, or UI placeholder
  is not an implementation.
- Scope durable state and cache/index keys by every applicable tenant, space, project, invoker/user,
  actor, extension/gadget, and policy version. Conceal inaccessible private resources exactly like
  absent resources. Security-sensitive resolution fails closed.
- Reauthorize immediately before external side effects, artifact commits, merges, connector calls,
  workflow dispatch, and sibling-project calls. Preserve the original human invoker through every
  delegation and background boundary.
- Add migrations and identical development/staging/production Wrangler bindings, service bindings,
  queues, workflows, R2/KV/Vectorize/Analytics resources, secrets documentation, rotations,
  backfills, limits, alarms, and rollback behavior required by the feature.
- Add the real shell experience where applicable, including loading, empty, error, unauthorized,
  offline/reconnecting, spectator/frozen, air-gapped, and completed states. Treat model and source
  data as untrusted; never execute supplied HTML, JavaScript, URLs, or expressions.
- Add contract, isolation, race, replay, expiry, crash/hibernation, fail-closed, and router-to-worker
  journeys using realistic Cloudflare behavior. Success-only mocks may not replace authorization,
  transactions, bindings, namespace isolation, alarms, WebSockets, or Workflow behavior.
- Update the requirements trace matrix only after verification. Mark an item IMPLEMENTED only when
  every required production boundary and meaningful integration/E2E evidence exists.

## Final resolved implementation specification

## Newest cross-cutting architectural delta (overrides conflicts)

# AVOS Evolutionary Architectural Changelog

This is the authoritative architectural delta for plan items 1–130. These decisions postdate the source trails and `CLAUDE.md`; they override conflicts while retaining compatible implementation detail.

## Final reconciled upgrades

1. **Universal swarm orchestrator.** Replace the five-avatar coworker roster with one sovereign `NaelaoAgentDO` lead. It turns goals into `SpaceDO.tasks` DAGs, forks isolated Artifact branches, dispatches ephemeral workers, and leaves the human as outcome definer and final approver.
2. **Executive Cabinet.** The Space Assistant primarily exposes `delegate_to_space_worker(worker_id, task)`. Isolated `project_manager_worker`, `treasury_worker`, `identity_worker`, and `comms_worker` receive mutually exclusive capabilities; no cabinet worker can cross its functional boundary.
3. **Bifurcated runtime.** Interactive prebuilt operators taking under 30 seconds use in-memory `NaelaoAgentDO` V8 actor RPC. Custom developer agents and durable batch sagas use Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows with retries and sleeping.
4. **Asymmetric topology.** Parent agents are persistent nouns owning threads and UI. Subagents are ephemeral verbs with only `ai`, `fs`, `cli`, `vault`, and `step`; they never create user threads or WebSockets and return one compact two-line receipt.
5. **SR-EEO races.** Critical tasks may run N isolated speculative branches. The first candidate satisfying the deterministic oracle wins; all competitors receive abort signals immediately and only the winner enters the ordinary authorized merge path.
6. **Three-depth ceiling.** Depth 1 is the lead, depth 2 a domain sub-planner, and depth 3 a leaf executor. Depth-3 runtimes do not receive any delegation capability, making depth 4 structurally impossible.
7. **Five credit defenses.** Enforce model tiering by depth, up-front task escrow, plan-based parallelism, early-exit token reclaim, and daily personal budget envelopes. Starter executes sequentially; higher plans may enable races.
8. **Shared-space collision defense.** Combine 15-minute atomic task leases, sibling spectator mode, >0.85 intent deduplication, and sponsor-conflict RFC freezes in authoritative `SpaceDO` storage.
9. **Immutable kernel, userspace extensions.** Extensions may add manuals, virtual CLIs, daemons, and viewports but cannot replace the agent loop, bypass Gatekeepers or WriteGuard, or commit unreviewed code to `main`.
10. **Durable daemons.** Pair project-scoped DO-facet SQLite state with resumable Workflows for AST indexing, finance reconciliation, and legal citation graphs. Daemons consume no active-chat CPU/tokens and expose approved project MCP tools only.
11. **Dual-role workflows.** Dynamic Workflows support both ephemeral AI tasks and project-owned company automations. Deterministic steps remain deterministic and AI is invoked only for declared semantic work.
12. **No-code subagent studio.** The shell builds declarative `NoCodeSubagentManifest` documents from authorized tools, skills, knowledge, and triggers; a precompiled `GenericSubagentWorkflow` executes them. Creators cannot grant permissions above their current role.
13. **Logical connector aliases.** Code names semantic aliases such as `inbound_mail`; `SpaceDO` maps them to physical accounts. Rebinding never changes project source.
14. **Pluggable `primary_calendar`.** Calendar access is a space-shared MCP connector supporting Google, Microsoft, CalDAV, or scoped SQLite fallback. Voice booking acquires a 15-second `ConcurrencyDO` slot hold before external calls.
15. **Dual-plane customer bots.** Public WhatsApp, Telegram, and voice traffic reaches quarantined ephemeral Workflow agents with `CustomerBotContext`, never internal project agents. Customer contexts have no Bash, file mutation, Git Artifact, or internal-vault capability.
16. **Automation failure defenses.** Production ingress includes KV tombstones, Queue buffering, 14-day R2 replay, a 5 req/s leaky-bucket pacer, SHA-256 idempotency, `x-avos-hop-count` recursion breaking, and lenient validated adapters. The remaining defenses already specified by the relevant plan items remain mandatory.
17. **Deliverable canvas.** `/workspace/` versions every deliverable type, including code, documents, spreadsheets, and data; executable agent machinery remains under Git-ignored `/.avos/`. Review cards render type-aware diffs while bytes remain authoritative.
18. **Strict UI bifurcation.** `apps/shell` is an Apple-clean client workspace with an 85% canvas, command bar, and one-click outcomes, with no model, compute-tier, or raw merge controls. `apps/partner-studio` is the technical foundry for ladder ceilings, daemons, workflows, and blueprint packaging.

## Supersession rule

Apply this delta after each item's complete Origin & Transition trail. If it conflicts with an earlier plan statement, this file wins. If it is silent, retain the earlier final decision. All authorization, tenant isolation, fail-closed policy, provenance, billing, deployment parity, and realistic end-to-end verification requirements remain in force.


### 43. 3-Layer Hybrid Memory Architecture

**Final behavior:** Memory separated into Working Context (DO RAM), Deterministic Project Truth (`PROJECT.md` in SQLite), and Long-Term Episodic/Semantic Memory (Vectorize).

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: memory OS + project memory client + SpaceDO memory routes.
Persistence/deployment: DO working/session state, project facts/wiki, Vectorize episodic/semantic records.
Required observable verification: memory OS/project-memory tests cover expiry, durable truth and scoped retrieval.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- The Gap: The KB stores document chunks as flat, independent vectors. No entity extraction or relationship mapping exists. For complex queries ("What is the relationship between product X and feature Y?"), the agent must retrieve many chunks and synthesize. A knowledge graph would dramatically improve complex reasoning.
 Required Fix: Add optional knowledge graph layer to KB ingestion: run NER (Named Entity Recognition) on chunks using a small local model (via CF AI). Extract entities and co-occurrence relationships. Store in KnowledgeBaseDO SQLite: CREATE TABLE kg_entities (id TEXT, label TEXT, type TEXT); CREATE TABLE kg_edges (from_id TEXT, to_id TEXT, relation TEXT, weight REAL) . On que
- The `MEMORY_VECTORIZE` binding's own `wrangler.toml` comment has always claimed Layer 5 semantic
recall is "queried by embedding + user_id filter" — the actual `recall()` code only ever filtered
Vectorize by `{spaceId: {$eq}}`, never `userId`. In shared-assistant mode (one DO/SQLite instance
serving multiple end users), this meant one user's promoted episodic memories were fully recallable
by every OTHER user sharing the same space — a real cross-user memory leak, not a documentation
typo, since the comment described intended behavior that the code never implemented. Fixed with a
two-query merge: Vectorize's flat `{field: {$eq}}` filter has no `OR`/`IN` support, so — mirroring
the exact `use

**Core Architectural Blueprint (Continued)**
* **Indirect Injection Security Firewalls:** Context-sanitization layers scan tool outputs, third-party web content, and retrieved vector chunks before prompt insertion [1.3.17]. Untrusted dynamic payloads are encapsulated in strict semantic boundary tags (e.g., `<untrusted_retrieval_chunk>`), explicitly signaling to the model's attention layers that text within these blocks cannot alter operational instructions or tool-dispatch policies [1.3.17].
* **Hierarchical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Every document ingestion payload registers access bitmasks (defining tenant, department, project, and specific user IDs). Queries executed by an agent inherit the authenticated user's permission bitmask, automatically discarding unauthorized seman

### 44. Cross-Thread Context Isolation

**Final behavior:** New threads start with a pristine context window. Message logs from previous threads are never injected, eliminating prompt pollution.

**Production acceptance contract:**
Production entry: conversation context, `NaelaoAgentDO` session addressing, memory retrieval filters.
Persistence/deployment: separate session/agent DO state + scoped project memory/Vectorize.
Required observable verification: conversation isolation tests create a second thread and assert no prior messages or unauthorized vectors.

**Retained implementation constraints:**
- The Gap After a tool executes, the spec forwards the raw tool output directly to the next streamText call with no interception point. This means: (1) a read_file result beginning with "Ignore all previous instructions..." is fed verbatim to the LLM (prompt injection via file content), (2) a list_directory on a 10,000-file directory returns a result that blows the context window, (3) tool results are never logged for audit/forensic purposes. The CF Think SDK's afterToolCall(toolName, args, result) fires after tool execution and before the result is appended to messages.
- **Frontend (`apps/shell`).** Real chat: `Chat.tsx` ports `apps/portal`'s proven SSE client
(session start/resume, SSE streaming with a polling fallback, optimistic user-message rendering)
onto the mockup's markup (`msg-row`/`bubble`/`chat-area`/`thread-panel` classes from
`packages/ui`) instead of Tailwind. Chat "sessions" (the message-history transport,
`SpaceDO.sessions`) and "threads" (the structural browse table, `SpaceDO.threads`) are separate
tables with **no server-side link yet** — `sessionKey={threadId}` keeps each thread's chat
session persisted independently client-side (`chatSession.ts`, keyed per `(spaceId, key)`,
ported from `apps/portal/src/lib/session.ts`), which is an honest

- #### Layer 1: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC / Hash Checkpoint)
Every file in your authoritative SQLite `workspace_files` table carries a **SHA-256 content hash**.
When an agent calls `Edit(filePath, oldString, newString)`, the DO SQLite write enforces a **Conditional Checkpoint**:
```sql
-- Atomic OCC Update in DO SQLite
UPDATE workspace_files
SET content = ?, hash = ?, size_bytes = ?, updated_at = datetime('now')
WHERE path = ? AND hash = ?; -- Verified against hash at start of turn!
```
* **If another user/agent edited the file mid-turn:** `changes === 0`. The DO throws an instant conflict exception:
  > `✖ Conflict Error: 'src/Header.astro' was modified by another thread 1.2s ago. Re-read lines before applying patch.`
* The agent reads the fresh lines with `Read` and self-heals its patch cleanly.

## Required execution and response

1. Convert every numbered specification above into a file/request-path checklist before editing.
2. Implement in dependency order and reuse canonical workers/DOs rather than parallel helpers.
3. Return complete apply-ready unified diffs for every changed, created, or deleted file. Do not use
   ellipses, pseudo-code, TODO-only stubs, omitted boilerplate, or comments standing in for code.
4. Include exact migration, provisioning, secret rotation, rollout/backfill, rollback, and staging
   smoke commands.
5. Include exact test/typecheck/config-parity commands and the security/race assertions they prove.
6. Finish with an item-by-item release ledger: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING with honest gaps.

For automation, put exactly one machine-readable line before the first diff:
`PHASE_STATUS: CONTINUE` when another implementation turn is required, or
`PHASE_STATUS: COMPLETE` only when every numbered item and verification boundary is finished.
Place all prose after the diff or in a separate `PHASE_NOTES` section. A COMPLETE response with no
apply-ready diff is valid only when the current branch already satisfies and verifies every item.

Do not silently omit an item. If one response cannot hold the implementation, stop only after an
atomic, testable commit boundary and return a continuation prompt containing the remaining numbered
specifications and current verification state. Never claim completion because code merely compiles.
